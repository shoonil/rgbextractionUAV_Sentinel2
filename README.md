# A cross-scale optical assessment of mangrove canopy using UAV and Sentinel-2 imagery

## Overview 
This repository contains the code and data for the manuscript 'A cross-scale optical assessment of mangrove canopy using UAV and Sentinel-2 imagery' submitted to Environmental Data Science. The project aims to compare/extract/analyze RGB spectral band values from UAV-captured imagery with Sentinel-2 satellite data to assess data fusion techniques for environmental monitoring.



## Data
*   **`Sentinel_UAV_RGB_Data_Nov_25_2025.xlsx`**: This Excel file contains the extracted RGB band values from UAV and Sentinel-2 imagery used in the analysis. The data is loaded directly into the notebook via its GitHub URL.

## Script file
- `ScriptForDataAnalysis_Sunil.ipynb`

## Usage
1.  Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Open and run `ScriptForDataAnalysis_Sunil.ipynb`.
3.  The notebook will automatically load the data from the linked Excel file within this repository.
